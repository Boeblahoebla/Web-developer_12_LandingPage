"# Web-developer_12_LandingPage" 

Repository combining everything I have learned so far in the form of a landing page of my (current) company
The goal of this project was to create a website combining the skills of HTML, CSS, Javascript but which now makes heavily use of Bootstrap v4.

It features a totally styled website which will be added to in the future and might be used as a starting platform for a possible migration from google drive services to an autonomous system using the latest technologies like Jquery, AngularJS, NodeJS and RESTful services.
